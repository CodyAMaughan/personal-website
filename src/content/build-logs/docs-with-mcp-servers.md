The speed of AI is humbling. New frameworks drop every week, and the knowledge cutoffs of even the best models (Gemini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) can't keep up.

I ran into this wall hard while building **"Say Play"** (my agentic video platform). I was trying to use the latest LangChain features, but my Agentic IDE kept hallucinating deprecated syntax. It didn't know the new APIs existed yet.

The solution wasn't better prompting—it was **Context Injection via MCP**.

### The Problem: Stale Context
I love building with "Antigravity" (my IDE setup), but it struggled with recent coding packages. It would confidently write code that was correct 3 months ago but broken today.

### The Fix: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
I discovered that LangChain offers an **MCP Server** for its documentation. Instead of pasting docs into the chat manually, I configured my IDE to fetch the latest docs dynamically.

Here is the config I added to my MCP settings:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "langchain-docs": {
            "serverUrl": "https://docs.langchain.com/mcp",
            "type": "sse"
        }
    }
}
```

### The Result
Instantly, the hallucination stopped. The agent understood the new architecture patterns and generated up-to-date implementation code for my video composition agents.

If you are building with Agentic IDEs, stop relying on the model's training data for bleeding-edge frameworks. Hook up an MCP server.

**Next up:** I'm using this stack to build the rendering engine for Say Play. More on that in the next log.
